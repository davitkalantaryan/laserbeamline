# PITZ laserbeamline  

## Hardware and OS
The project was initially developed for SPARC architecture 
for solaris 8 OS. The application was running on VME crate. Namely the crate is 
vmepitz06.  
Because no support for VME crates and solaris (???) the control will be migrated to Raspberry pi 
Raspberry pi [serial interface]() interface will be used
