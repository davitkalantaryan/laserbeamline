 *  @section intro Introduction
 * 
 *  This is the DOOCS server library, being the central part of every
 *  DOOCS server. This library is available as static or shared library
 *  and called libEqServer.a or libEqServer.so.\n
 *  The two most important classes are EqFct as location class and D_fct for all the property types\n
 *  Every DOOCS server needs to be linked at least against this library
 *  and the DOOCS client library libDOOCSapi.
 *  The file eq_server.cc contains the main() function for a server.
